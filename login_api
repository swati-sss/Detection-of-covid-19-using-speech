CPU / Battery Profiling – With Compass SDK

I profiled MyWalmart with Compass SDK using CPU Profiler to check if Compass/IPS is causing higher CPU usage or battery drain.

Idle behavior
When the app is idle CPU usage stays low around a few %. Even though IPSFramework / compass sdk ios shows up with a higher percentage in the call tree, this is only a percentage of the small amount of CPU being used at that time, not high overall CPU usage. This does not indicate battery drain by itself.

Scrolling / interaction
CPU spikes happen mainly while scrolling or interacting with the app. These spikes are very short, around 10 ms. Most of the CPU during these spikes comes from React Native / Hermes (RCTJSThreadManager, facebook::react, hermes::vm). Compass / IPS shows up in some of these spikes but is not the main contributor.

Compass specific work
Compass related methods (like initialization/configuration) appear only at expected points and with low self-weight. There is no continuous or long running CPU activity coming from Compass.

Conclusion
Based on CPU profiling, I don’t see any sustained CPU usage caused by Compass SDK or IPSFramework. The CPU spikes are short and are mostly UI/JS related, which is expected during scrolling.
