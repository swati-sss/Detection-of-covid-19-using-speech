  PR 1 – Feature flags + environment tuning (no local-map work)

  - Expanded the SwiftUI feature flags screen to cover every StoreConfig field, grouped by category, with nested navigation/map UI/pins support and sheet-based editing.
  - Refactored Compass’ debug override path to accept all config values (booleans, numbers, nested structs) so the UI and SDK stay in sync.
  - Made the environment settings editable at runtime (backend env, token type, mock user, account ID, default store), added safety checks, and re-initialize Compass
    automatically when values change.
  - Added mock-user toggling logic on the sample side so the blue dot reflects UI state, plus better store-id normalization and cleanup when restarting Compass.
  - General UX improvements in the sample app (Env/Flags menu, shared HomeViewModel, console log helpers, etc.).
